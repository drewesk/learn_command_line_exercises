# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

> Command for making directories: `mkdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t`,
Command for removing those same directories: `rmdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t`

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

> Command for making a path of directories 10 levels deep: `mkdir dir1 dir1/2 dir1/2/3 dir1/2/3/4 dir1/2/3/4/5 dir1/2/3/4/5/6` `....`

### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.

> Command I looked up, ahead of chapter 7, to find: `rm -r {dirName}` to delete a directory with contents.
