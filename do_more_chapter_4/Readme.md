# Chapter 4: Make a directory (mkdir)

## Do More

### The concept of a "path" might confuse you at this point. Don't worry. We'll do a lot more with them and then you'll get it.

### Make 20 other directories inside the temp directory in various levels. Go look at them with a graphical file browser.

> I made the initial four directories `mkdir temp1 temp2 temp3 temp4`,
> Then I consecutively added 5 levels to each one ``mkdir temp1/"hello mannn"/3/4/5``.
> I went to the finder to confirm that all temp directories 1-4 had the same mirroring 5 levels of folders/directories.

### Make a directory with a space in the name by putting quotes around it

##### `mkdir temp1/"hello mannn"`
