### I ran the command `pwd` in terminal 60+ times, saying 'print working directory' out-loud. 
### The output was:
### `/Users/Drew/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`
### I opened the `Finder` icon on my dock, clicked the strategically placed 
### `davinci_coders_t3_2016` tab in the side bar,
### opened the `homework` file, and lastly the `learn_command_line _exercises file`
### to see the location in the graphical file browser.
