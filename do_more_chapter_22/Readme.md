# Chapter 22: Changing Environment Variables (export)

## Do More

### Take and list out all the environment variables you've found and then go look up what they are online (please do 5-10 or so).

> `er_22 Drew$ env`

> __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING, _system_arch, _system_name, _system_type, _system_version, 
> Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render, GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH, HOME, IRBRC, ITERM_PROFILE, ITERM_SESSION_ID,
> LANG, LOGNAME, MY_RUBY_HOME, OLDPWD, OSX, PATH, PWD, RUBY_VERSION, rvm_bin_path, rvm_path, 
> rvm_prefix, rvm_version, SHELL, SHLVL, SSH_AUTH_SOCK, TERM, TERM_PROGRAM, TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION, 
> TERM_SESSION_ID, TMPDIR, USER, XPC_FLAGS, XPC_SERVICE_NAME

> I researched 10 easy variables.


### Read the man page for env again. What else can it do?

> man def: set environment and execute command, or print environment
> env allows me to view current variable settings, 
> potentially modify the set value,
> and therefore update the settings/see current env status info.
