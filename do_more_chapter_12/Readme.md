# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

> I provided a copy of ex12.txt on this directory for your viewing pleasure.

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

> `cp ~/desktop/ex12.txt ~/temp/ex12.txt` I saved the file to my desktop and executed this command.
    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

> `less ~/desktop/ex12.txt` to open file viewing mode.
I found `more` command did the same thing with a file of this size.
>  I found arrow keys were most comfortable, 
I've also enabled the terminal to allow the mouse wheel to scroll through at any speed.

### Look at some of the empty files you created too.

> `less ~/temp/iamcool.txt` This command produced the same file viewing mode and empty lines starting with `~` (tilda symbol).

### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.

> Thanks for the info!
