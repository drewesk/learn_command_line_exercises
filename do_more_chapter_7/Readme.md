# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

>`mkdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t`
`rmdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t`

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

>`mkdir dir1 dir1/2 dir1/2/3 dir1/2/3/4 dir1/2/3/4/5 dir1/2/3/4/5/6` `....`

### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.

>`rm -r {dirName}`
