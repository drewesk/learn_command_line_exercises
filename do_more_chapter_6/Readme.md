# Chapter 6: List Directory (ls)

## Do More

### On Unix, try the ls -lR command while you're in temp.

>`ls -lR` in mac osx terminal? I dont think this is Unix haha.
Output:
`total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 Drew  staff  102 Oct  1 22:24 stuff`

>`./stuff:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 Drew  staff  102 Oct  1 22:24 things`

>`./stuff/things:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 Drew  staff  102 Oct  1 22:24 frank`


### Use cd to get to other directories on your computer then use ls to see what's in them.

>`cd stuff/things/`
>
>`ls`
>
>:`frank`

### Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.

### Remember that if you get lost, then use ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd.
